# Test data in your pipeline

The files in this folder support the guide to [Test data in a pipeline](https://docs.soda.io/soda/quick-start-prod.html) in Soda documentation.

Use the guide to install and set up Soda to test the quality of your data in your Airflow pipeline. Automatically catch data quality issues after ingestion or transformation to prevent negative downstream impact.
